            <h2>Learn More About Indian Income Tax for FY 2024-25(AY 2025-26)</h2>
            <p><strong>Note: </strong> TaxMaster calculates tax of a salarized person only.</p>
            <p>Here is the detailed information about income tax, including how it is calculated, different tax brackets, deductions, and any other relevant information.</p>
            <h3>Why 2 Types of Taxes ?</h3>
            <p>The Budget 2020 saw the finance minister Mrs. Nirmala Sitharaman announced a new tax regime with more tax slabs and lower tax rates.
                This was long demanded by most taxpayers and economists but it came with the catch of removal of all the deductions and exemptions that
                were available under the old tax regime.To add to this confusion, the finance minister gave taxpayers a choice between the
                new regime and the existing one, leaving it to them to decide which they would like to opt for.
                All these factors acting together,instead of tax laws getting simpler, they are now became more complex.</p>
            <h3>What the new tax regime provides ?</h3>
            <p>The option of new tax regime is available to all individuals and Hindu Undivided Family (HUF). This is optional. Under the new tax regime tax is payable at lower 
                slab rates on the income up to Rs. 15 lakh as compared to old regime. Under the new regime tax slabs rates of 5%, 10%, 15%, 20% and 25% 
                are applicable on each successive increase of Rs. 2.50 lakh starting from the basic exemption of Rs. 2.5 lakh till 15 lakhs of total income.
                
                If you wish to opt for the new tax regime you have to forgo various tax deductions and exemptions otherwise available under old regime.
                Under the new tax regime, salaried people cannot avail major benefits of items like standard deduction, House Rent Allowance (HRA),
                 Leave Travel Assistance (LTA) and even some of the allowances allowed for performing duties. Various deductions like those available under 
                Section 80 C (comprised of various items like EPF, LIP, School Fee, PPF, NSC, ELSS, home loan repayment etc.) , 80D (for health insurance premiums) , 
                80 CCD(1) & 80 CCD(1B) (for NPS) will also not be available to both categories of taxpayer i.e. salaried and self-employed. You also forfeit
                 the claim for home loan interest for self-occupied as well as to set off or carry forward the loss in respect of let out property.
                 You also will not be able to set off any brought forward losses against current income under new scheme.
                Likewise retired senior citizen cannot claim standard deduction against pension received by them in respect of their past employment.
                 Deduction up to Rs. 50,000 available to senior citizen for interest from post office and banks u/s 80TTB will also not be available.</p>
            <h3>How the scheme works ?</h3>
            <p>As one can claim various exemptions and deduction and the composition of these tax benefits widely differ from person to person, 
                a readymade comparative calculation chart cannot be given as to depict which regime is beneficial. However, looking at the tax 
                benefits which majority of the taxpayer have to forgo, the benefits available with existing regime outweigh the benefits of 
                lower rates of tax by migrating to new regime. Let us try to understand the implications with examples.
                
                Let us take case of a salaried person. Since majority of salaried either claim benefit of HRA for rent paid or in all
                 probability would have bought a house with home loan. Presuming he has bought a house with home loan, he has to forgo home 
                loan benefits for interest as well as principal repayment for 3.50 lakh taken together comprised of 1.50 lakh under Section 80C 
                for principal prepayment and Rs. 2 lakh for home loan interest for self-occupied house property. After taking into account the 
                fact that he also will have to forgo standard deduction of Rs. 50,000/-, he will have to forgo to deduction of Rs. 4,00,000/-
                 resulting in tax impact of Rs. 80,000 if he is in 20% tax slab having income between â‚¹5 lakh to 10 lakh. The net tax benefit 
                forgone is higher than the tax liability of Rs. 62,500 under new scheme. For those in 30% tax slab the tax effect of the benefit 
                forgone @ 30% would be 1.20 lakh against the tax saving of Rs. 37,500 accruing by opting for new regime.</p>
            <h3>Switching from one regime to another.</h3>
            <p>The salaried have the option to choose between both the regimes every year. Even if you have opted a particular tax regime with your employer, 
                you can still choose the other regime while filing your ITR in case the other option seems more beneficial to you while computing the tax 
                liability at the time of filing the ITR.
                
                Please note that the self-employed do not have the choice to come back to old tax regime once the new one is opted unless they stop having 
                business income. So the person with business income has to be vary careful while migrating to new regime as it is only one way journey for them.
                
                Whether the new scheme works for you or the old one will depend on composition of your income and deductions available and one will have to
                 take decision based on his circumstances.</p>
            <h3>Calculation of the Tax!</h3>
            <p>Let us take an example of a person having income of Rs. 10 lakh. Under the old regime, he will be entitled to a standard deduction of Rs. 50,000. Under the new regime, the tax 
                liability will be Rs. 75,000. However, the person can only claim the standard deduction and has to forgo the deduction under Section 80C under the new regime.</p>

            <p>In case of <strong>New Tax Regime</strong>, the total annual income is only deducted from the standard deduction of Rs. 75,000. The tax is calculated on the remaining amount as per the tax slabs.</p>
            <p> Now, in our Calculator we are also following the <strong>Rebate Policy </strong> where the tax is calculated on the total income(i.e including all the deductions) and then the rebate is applied on the tax amount, which is Rs.25,000 for upto Rs.7Lakhs</p>
            <p>Next a cess rate of 4% is applied on the total tax amount to get the final tax amount if an user has to pay tax otherwise the cess rate is zero.</p>


            <p>Similarly, the tax is calculated for the <strong>Old Tax Regime</strong> where the total income is deducted from the standard deduction of Rs. 50,000 and the tax is calculated on the remaining amount as per the tax slabs.</p>
            <p> But the rebate amount is Rs.12,500 for upto Rs.5Lakhs. and the calculation for cess rate is same as new regime.</p>
            <h4>Note : In Old regime, the tax slabs are again also divided into 3 categories i.e. General, Senior Citizen and Super Senior Citizen.</h4>
            <p>We have provided the detailed tax slabs for FY 2024-25 (AY 2025-26) in our website.</p>

            <p> Lastly, <strong>Surcharge Rate</strong> is applied on the total tax amount if the total income is more than Rs.50Lakhs.</p>
